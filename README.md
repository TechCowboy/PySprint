# PySprint
Remake the Atari ST port of Super Sprint by Electric Dreams from 1985 in Python with Pygame

The idea is to:
- Get as close to the original as possible in terms of gameplay
- Fix the very few annoying things (mandatory wait of 5secs before each race for example)
- Add features like custom tracks and cars, custom music, and hopefully remote multiplayer...
- Learn Python and have fun!
